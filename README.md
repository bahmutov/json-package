## Install and use

    npm install -g json-package

Installs shortcuts "jso" and "j"

Then use `jso <property name prefix>` to show any property from `package.json`

Example: show version

    jso v
    j v

If there are multiple properties starting with the same prefix, the `jso` will show choices

## Differences from `npm view <package name> [property]`

There is a command [npm view](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/view) that can do the same -
and more. I prefer using `json-package` for these reasons

* `json-package` only does the local lookup, thus faster and less typing
* `json-package` matches property by prefix, again less typing
